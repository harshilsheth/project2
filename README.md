Asp.net project
The objective of “DREAM TOURS & TRAVELS” is to completely automate the following processes.
The main objective of the project is to establish a complete dynamic website. 
In our website, we made concern only on 3 roles i.e. Admin, User and Visitor. Admin can 
easily make changes in the database. All the information can be easily accessed and shared 
by the Users. This system provides users to viewall our package details. If they like any 
package then they can easily register themselves to book their tickets. This website also provides
the facility of getting the password via mail incase the user forgets.
